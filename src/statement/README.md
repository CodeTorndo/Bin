### Statement

Statement is a list of all past transactions.

There are different types of transactions:

* Buy
* Sell
* Deposit
* Withdraw
* More?

Only Buy and Sell have contractId associated with. Thus 'details' can not be seen for the rest.

Current implementation makes Profit Table unnecessary.
